# 🎙️ Vox-Assistant

A simple voice assistant built using Python. It converts text into spoken audio using the Google Text-to-Speech API (`gTTS`), allowing basic interactions via voice.

---

## 🧠 How it works
- You type a command or a message.
- The assistant converts it into speech using gTTS.
- The resulting audio is played using `playsound`.
